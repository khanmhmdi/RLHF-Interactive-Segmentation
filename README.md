The First Phase and Implementation of Interactive Segmentation

## Proposed Method: DDPG for Interactive Segmentation
The objective of this PhD proposal is to develop a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) method aimed at identifying errors in baseline models, such as the U-Net baseline. The identified errors will be used to generate prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Below is a prototype of the proposed method.
